    "## Running FISSA\n",
    "\n",
    "With the function-based interface to FISSA, everything is handled in a single function call to [fissa.run_fissa](https://fissa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/packages/fissa.core.html#fissa.core.run_fissa). The function takes as its input is the raw signals, and returns the decontaminated signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mandatory inputs to [fissa.run_fissa](https://fissa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/packages/fissa.core.html#fissa.core.run_fissa) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the experiment images\n",
    "- the regions of interest (ROIs) to extract\n",
    "\n",
    "Images can be given as a path to a folder containing tiff stacks:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "images = \"folder\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each of these tiff-stacks in the folder (e.g. `\"folder/trial_001.tif\"`) is a trial with many frames.\n",
    "Although we refer to one trial as an `image`, it is actually a video recording.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the image data can be given as a list of paths to tiffs:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "images = [\"folder/trial_001.tif\", \"folder/trial_002.tif\", \"folder/trial_003.tif\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "or as a list of arrays which you have already loaded into memory:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "images = [array1, array2, array3, ...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the regions of interest (ROIs) input, you can either provide a single set of ROIs, or a set of ROIs for every image.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the ROIs were defined using ImageJ, use ImageJ's export function to save them in a zip.\n",
    "Then, provide the ROI filename.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "rois = \"rois.zip\"  # for a single set of ROIs used across all images\n",
    "```\n",
    "The same set of ROIs will be used for every image in `images`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes there is motion between trials causing the alignment of the ROIs to drift.\n",
    "In such a situation, you may need to use a slightly different location of the ROIs for each trial.\n",
    "This can be handled by providing FISSA with a list of ROI sets — one ROI set (i.e. one ImageJ zip file) per trial.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "rois = [\"rois1.zip\", \"rois2.zip\", ...]  # for a unique roiset for each image\n",
    "```\n",
    "Please note that the ROIs defined in each ROI set must correspond to the same physical reigons across all trials, and that the order must be consistent.\n",
    "That is to say, the 1st ROI listed in each ROI set must correspond to the same item appearing in each trial, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to use FISSA with ImageJ ROI sets, saved as zip files.\n",
    "However, you are not restricted to providing your ROIs to FISSA in this format.\n",
    "FISSA will also accept ROIs which are arbitrarily defined by providing them as arrays (`numpy.ndarray` objects).\n",
    "ROIs provided in this way can be defined either as boolean-valued masks indicating the presence of a ROI per-pixel in the image, or defined as a list of coordinates defining the boundary of the ROI.\n",
    "For examples of such usage, see our [Suite2p](https://fissa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Suite2p%20example.html), [CNMF](https://fissa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/cNMF%20example.html), and [SIMA](https://fissa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/SIMA%20example.html) example notebooks."
